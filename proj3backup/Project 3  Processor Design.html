    <h1>Project 3: Processor Design</h1>
    <p>CS61C Summer 2014</p>
    <p>Due <em class="e">Sunday, August 10, 2014 @ 23:59:59</em></p>
    <p>TA: Kevin Liston</p>
    
    <h2>Updates</h2>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Clarified that both ALU shift amounts should be determined by only the lower 
          five bits of the second operand.</li>
      <li>Added the interface for the instruction memory to the CPU section.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>In this project, you will be implementing a 2-stage pipelined processor for the 
       Ida 2 assembly language (a language designed specifically for this project!). 
       It is absolutely necessary to thoroughly read the <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su14/proj/03/manual.html">Ida 2 Manual</a> to be able to 
       complete this project, as there are substantial difference from familiar assembly 
       languages such as MIPS.</p>
       
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    
    <p>You are allowed to complete this project with one partner, or by yourself. Make 
       sure that if you work with a partner, only one of you submits the project. In the 
       case of two submissions from you and your partner, there is no guarantee which 
       one we will grade. Whoever submits must list their partner's login in the file 
       <b><tt>PARTNER.txt</tt></b> before submitting (or leave it as is if you are 
       working alone).</p>
    
    <p>You are not allowed to show or share your project files with any other student, 
       friend, and such, except for your project partner. This also includes files you 
       write specifically for testing purposes. We have various tools at our disposal to 
       detect plagiarism.</p>
       
    <p>Before you begin, pull the skeleton files to your directory. Like before, you can 
       reset the remote alias with the following commands:</p>
       
    <p>
      <kbd>cd ~/work</kbd>
      <kbd>git remote rm projects</kbd>
      <kbd>git remote add projects git@github.com:ucberkeley-cs61c/projects_su14.git</kbd>
    </p>
    
    <p>Then you can pull the skeleton files as usual:</p>
    
    <p>
      <kbd>cd ~/work</kbd>
      <kbd>git pull projects master</kbd>
    </p>
    
    <p>The following project files are given:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><b><tt>RUN.circ</tt></b> - wires all circuits together, contains all RAM 
          memory, and runs the entire processor. Do not modify this file.</li>
      <li><b><tt>CPU.circ</tt></b> - contains the control logic.</li>
      <li><b><tt>REG.circ</tt></b> - contains the general purpose registers.</li>
      <li><b><tt>ALU.circ</tt></b> - performs arithmetic operations.</li>
      <li><b><tt>CMP.circ</tt></b> - handles comparison checking.</li>
      <li><b><tt>NPC.circ</tt></b> - computes the next program counter.</li>
      <li><b><tt>PIP.circ</tt></b> - contains the pipeline barrier.</li>      
      <li><b><tt>Assemble.jar</tt></b> - assembles Ida 2 code into Logisim hex files.</li>
      <li><b><tt>fib.ida</tt></b> - a sample test program.</li>   
      <li><b><tt>Check.jar</tt></b> - checks your circuit files for incompatibilities.</li>
      <li><b><tt>PARTNER.txt</tt></b> - contains your partner's login.</li>
      <li><b><tt>proj3.marker</tt></b> - indicates that this is your project 3 submission.</li>          
      <li><b><tt>CheckSubmission.py</tt></b> - checks your submission.</li>  
    </ol>
       
       
    <h3>Working With Logisim</h3>
    <p>It is strongly recommended that you download 
       <a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/">Logisim</a> and to run on 
       your local machine while developing your processor to avoid overwhelming the 
       instructional machines. The official version of Logisim we will be using for 
       evaluation is v2.7.1.</p>
    <p>When working with Logisim, be wary of red wires (error signals), blue wires 
       (unknown signals), and orange wires (wires with conflicting widths). You can use 
       the poke tool to poke wires to check their values, and trace the source of 
       problems in the wiring. Here are some examples of things to watch out for:</p>

    <h2>Circuit Organization</h2>  
    
    
    <h3>RUN</h3> 
    
    <p>At first glance, you will notice that <b><tt>RUN.circ</tt></b> is filled with blue 
       and undefined wire signals. These errors will not go away until you have completed 
       most of, if not all six parts of this project.</p>
    
    <p>It is also important to note the peculiar layout of the top-level 
       <b><tt>RUN.circ</tt></b> circuit, which looks utterly unlike the familiar MIPS 
       data path. Observe the following diagram. On the left, circuit A has two 
       subcircuits: B and C. On the right, a new circuit D has three subcircuits: A, B, 
       and C. Note that these are equivalent, though the righthand one has the added 
       benefit that each subcircuit can be evaluated independently from the rest.</p>
    
    <img src="./Project 3  Processor Design_files/boxes.png">
    
    <p>This is exactly how the project files are laid out. The top-level circuit is 
       <b><tt>RUN.circ</tt></b>, directly containing all other circuits, and wiring them 
       together as necessary. The would-be top-level circuit <b><tt>CPU.circ</tt></b> is 
       a subcircuit in the same way as A in the previous diagram is. Note that since it 
       will not be graded in any capacity, <em class="e"><b><tt>RUN.circ</tt></b> should 
       not be modified</em>.</p>    
       
    <h3>Part 1: ALU</h3>
    <p>The ALU contains basically all arithmetic operations required to execute any 
       instruction. The following table lists the required input and output interface of 
       the ALU circuit.</p>
    <table>

      </tbody>
    </table>
    
              
    <h3>Part 2: REG</h3>
    <p>This is the general purpose register file, a circuit that contains every general 
       purpose register. This file allows reading and writing to registers when needed. 
       The following table lists the required input and output interface of the REG 
       circuit.</p>       
    <table>
      <thead><tr><td>Input</td><td>Bits</td><td>Purpose</td></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>REG_1_READ</td><td>4</td><td>the first register to read</td></tr>

        <tr><td>R00 - R15</td><td>32</td><td>the pre-update content of each general register</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <h3>Part 3: CMP</h3>
    <p>This unit contains the comparison result register, and logic to access and modify 
       it. Be sure to review the way the comparison values work in the <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su14/proj/03/manual.html">Ida 2 Manual</a>. The 
       following table lists the required input and output interface of the CMP 
       circuit.</p>    
    <table>
      <thead><tr><td>Input</td><td>Bits</td><td>Purpose</td></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>CQ_QUERY</td><td>3</td><td>the comparison query from the current instruction</td></tr>
        <tr><td>LT</td><td>1</td><td>a "less than" result from the ALU</td></tr>
        <tr><td>EQ</td><td>1</td><td>an "equal to" result from the ALU</td></tr>
        <tr><td>GT</td><td>1</td><td>a "greater than" result from the ALU</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CR_WRITE</td><td>1</td><td>if the current instruction enables writing to the comparison register</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CLOCK</td><td>1</td><td>the clock pulse (you may use registers in this circuit)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
      <thead><tr><td>Output</td><td>Bits</td><td>Purpose</td></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>CR_VAL</td><td>3</td><td>the current value of the comparison register</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CQ_PASSED</td><td>1</td><td>if the comparison query passes for the current instruction</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
       
    <h3>Part 4: NPC</h3>
    <p>This module contains logic to calculate and select the next program counter. The 
       following table lists the required input and output interface of the NPC 
       circuit.</p> 
    <table>
      <thead><tr><td>Input</td><td>Bits</td><td>Purpose</td></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>INSTRUCTION</td><td>32</td><td>the current instruction</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CURRENT_PC</td><td>24</td><td>the current program counter value</td></tr>
        <tr><td>JUMP_ADDRESS</td><td>24</td><td>the jump address component of the current instruction</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CQ_PASSED</td><td>1</td><td>if the INSTRUCTION passed its comparison test</td></tr>
      </tbody>
      <thead><tr><td>Output</td><td>Bits</td><td>Purpose</td></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>NEXT_PC</td><td>24</td><td>the program counter to use to fetch the next instruction</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <h3>Part 5: PIP</h3>
    <p>This unit contains the pipelining logic of the processor. You will be implementing 
       a 2-stage pipeline, specifically including the following stages:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Instruction Fetch</b> - an instruction is fetched from instruction memory</li>
      <li><b>Everything Else</b> - the instruction is decoded, executed, data memory is
          touched, and then the results are written back</li>
    </ol> 
    <p>Note that data hazards are not present in this design, since every data access 
       from any source occurs only in one pipeline stage. However, control hazards must 
       still be accounted for. Ida 2 does not expose branch delay slots to software. 
       In other words, the instruction immediately after a jump is not executed if the 
       jump actually occurs. By the time you have figured out that a jump is in the 
       execute stage, you have already accessed the instruction memory and possibly 
       pulled out the wrong instruction. Thus you will need to kill the instruction being 
       fetched if the instruction currently being executed is a taken jump (which is to 
       say that jumps that are not taken should not cause a kill).</p>
    <p>Instruction kills for this project <b>must</b> be accomplished by MUXing a nop 
       into the instruction stream within this <b><tt>PIP.circ</tt></b>. The nop will 
       then be sent into the execute stage (instead of using the fetched instruction). 
       Notice that every Ida 2 instruction contains numerous possible nops (every 
       instruction can be turned into a nop using the ?NO comparison). However, you must 
       use an all-zero instruction (0x00000000) as the nop, for grading purposes.</p>
    <p><b>All</b> pipelining-related circuitry is contained within this single circuit, 
       so switching back and forth between a one and two stage design should be trivial. 
       A project that is pipelined runs almost identically to one that is not (due to 
       how logisim handles timing). When pipelining, you will notice two things in 
       particular. First, there will be a startup delay cycle. Second, when performing a 
       halting loop, the processor will jump between two different lines indefinitely. 
       These are both correct behaviors.</p>
    <p>The following table lists the required input and output interface of the PIP 
       circuit.</p>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><td>Input</td><td>Bits</td><td>Purpose</td></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>INSTRUCTION_IN</td><td>32</td><td>the current instruction entering the pipeline barrier</td></tr>
        <tr><td>PC_IN</td><td>24</td><td>the current program counter associated with INSTRUCTION_IN</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CQ_PASSED</td><td>1</td><td>if INSTRUCTION_OUT passed its comparison test</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CLOCK</td><td>1</td><td>the clock pulse (you may use registers in this circuit)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
      <thead><tr><td>Output</td><td>Bits</td><td>Purpose</td></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>INSTRUCTION_OUT</td><td>32</td><td>the instruction exiting the pipeline barrier</td></tr>
        <tr><td>PC_OUT</td><td>24</td><td>the program counter associated with INSTRUCTION_OUT</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
      
    <h3>Part 6: CPU</h3>    
    <p>The CPU contains all control logic. This file contains inputs and outputs shaped 
       as if it contained every other circuit in this project. The function of these 
       interfaces were defined previously. Essentially, the CPU contains instruction 
       decoding and control signals. The CPU should function correctly, independent of 
       your specific implementations of the rest of the circuits.</p>
       
    <p>You will notice that the CPU also contains a memory module and instruction module, 
       both actually located in <b><tt>RUN.circ</tt></b>. You do not need to modify or 
       complete these modules, as they are done for you. However, so that you can use 
       them correctly, here is the interface for the instruction memory module:</p>
       
    <table>
      <thead><tr><td>Input</td><td>Bits</td><td>Purpose</td></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>JUMP_ADDRESS</td><td>24</td><td>an address to use in calculating the next program counter</td></tr>
      </tbody>
      <thead><tr><td>Output</td><td>Bits</td><td>Purpose</td></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>INSTRUCTION</td><td>32</td><td>the instruction to execute</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CURRENT_PC</td><td>24</td><td>the program counter associated with INSTRUCTION</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <p>And here is the interface for the data memory module:</p>    
   
    <table>
      <thead><tr><td>Input</td><td>Bits</td><td>Purpose</td></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>MEM_ADDR</td><td>24</td><td>an address to read from (and write to, if MEM_WRITE is enabled)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>MEM_IN</td><td>32</td><td>the data to write to memory at MEM_ADDR, if MEM_WRITE is enabled</td></tr>
        <tr><td>MEM_WRITE</td><td>1</td><td>if writing to memory is enabled</td></tr>
      </tbody>
      <thead><tr><td>Output</td><td>Bits</td><td>Purpose</td></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>MEM_OUT</td><td>32</td><td>the contents of memory at MEM_ADDR</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
          
    
    
    
    
               
    <h2>Testing</h2>
    
    <p>Testing the individual components of your processor would involve checking that 
       for every input, the output is as is expected. While this process is tedious, you 
       should definitely devote some time to testing in this manner. However, once you've 
       implemented your processor entirely, you can test its correctness by writing 
       programs to run on it! Be sure to review the <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su14/proj/03/manual.html">Ida 2 Manual</a> thoroughly.</p>         
       
    <p>Once you have the assembler and a program to run, you can assemble Ida 2 files 
       using the following command, which takes a list of files to batch assemble:</p>     
    
    <p><kbd>java -jar Assemble.jar fib.ida</kbd></p>
    
    <p>After a hex file has been assembled, it can be loaded into a logisim instruction 
       memory RAM unit. You might also want to load a similar hex file into the data 
       memory RAM unit, or otherwise edit the data memory directly. Before running the 
       processor, be sure to first reset the simulation, and then load the appropriate 
       hex files.</p>
       
    <img src="./Project 3  Processor Design_files/load.png">
       
    <p>Please note that you are expected to fully test your processor, both as a whole 
       and as individual circuits. Doing so is the only way for you to know if you 
       completed everything correctly. This project is graded on correctness, and while 
       it is split into 6 isolated parts (allowing for various partial credit), these 
       parts are not worth equal amounts, as they are not equally difficult. Partial 
       credit within each component varies as well.</p>
       
       
    <h2>Grading Considerations</h2>  
    
    
    <p>This project has specifically been designed to be graded piecewise. 
       <em class="e">Each individual file will be graded entirely in isolation of the 
       others</em>, which means that any problems in one file will only impact the 
       portion of the grade allocated to that one part and none of the rest. However, 
       this also means that diverging from any of the previously listed interface 
       requirements for any circuit component will be penalized on both sides of the 
       interface.</p>
    
    <p>Because this project does not involve compiling code, there are several critical 
       issues that might come up that should be noted. <em class="e">Note that these 
       issues are each severe enough to receive substantial penalties during grading 
       without consideration of intent</em>, as many of these issues are comparable to 
       submitting uncompilable code.</p>
    
    <h3>Detectable Issues</h3>
    
    <p>You can run the following command to check all six of your circuit files.</p>
    <p><kbd>java -jar Check.jar</kbd></p>
    
    <p>You can also test individual files as well.</p>
    <p><kbd>java -jar Check.jar ALU.circ</kbd></p>    
    
    <p>This command will print either <b><tt>OKAY</tt></b> or <b><tt>FAIL</tt></b> for 
       each of the required circuit files. It will also list the reason for failure, 
       which would be one of the following critical errors:</p>
       
    <ol>
      <li><em class="e">does not match the reference</em> - Involves adding, deleting, or 
          moving any input or output pins. Doing this usually alters where these pins 
          appear when the circuit is used. This is by far the easiest mistake to make, 
          and it is also easy to fix. Simply obtain a fresh copy of the file and copy 
          over everything except the input and output pins from your broken file.</li>
      <li><em class="e">there is no "main" circuit</em> - Involves renaming the main 
          circuits within the submitted files. They should be named "main" internally. 
          Changing this name makes it difficult to find the intended circuit for grading, 
          especially if there are subcircuits.</li>
      <li><em class="e">contains a clock pin</em> - Involves using the special clock pins 
          anywhere inside the submitted files. Thus if there is no input pin labeled as 
          being a clock signal, then you are not supposed to use the clock in that 
          particular circuit. Specifically, you will find it impossible to use the clock 
          within the <b><tt>ALU.circ</tt></b>, <b><tt>NPC.circ</tt></b>, and 
          <b><tt>CPU.circ</tt></b> files.</li>
      <li><em class="e">contains a trigger not on the rising edge</em> - Involves 
          updating any component on something other than the rising edge of the clock. 
          This option often causes other difficult to locate problems.</li>
      <li><em class="e">contains an external file</em> - Involves including external file 
          circuits. Only the required files will be graded. Any files that attempt to 
          link external files cannot be graded. Instead, use internal sub-circuits as 
          appropriate.</li>
      <li><em class="e">file does not exist</em> - Involves missing a file. Files you do 
          not submit will get no credit.</li>
      <li><em class="e">file is unreadable</em> - Involves a broken file format. This 
          checking program only performs minimal assurance that your files are not 
          broken. Opening your files in Logisim is a much safer check for this. 
          Obviously, if Logisim cannot read your file, you will get no credit for it, 
          even if this check does not say that it is unreadable.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Passing this check does not guarantee the absence of these or other errors in 
       your project. However, <em class="e">you will definitely receive no credit for 
       submitting a file that fails this check</em>, without any leniency.</p>
    
    <h3>Undetectable Issues</h3>
    
    <p>The following often result in an incorrect solution. While these issues are not 
       explicitly checked for during grading, they are no less severe. Try to avoid all 
       of these issues as they will likely (but not assuredly) break your solution.</p>    
    <ol>
      <li>Outputting unknowns or error signals (such as X/?/E). Your circuits should 
          never do this for any output. If you see X/?/E symbols in outputs, or if you 
          see red/blue/orange wires anywhere in your solutions, it might be incorrect, 
          and is very likely to be heavily penalized!</li>
      <li>Gating the clock. This refers to plugging a clock signal into any component's 
          input that is not explicitly labeled as a clock input. Gating the clock can 
          cause problems similar to updating on the falling edge of the clock.</li>
      <li>Having any wires with unknowns, errors, or conflicting widths (these show up as 
          X/E/? and red, blue, or orange wires). Wires such as these can cause 
          unpredictable behavior. Again, if you see red/blue/orange wires anywhere in 
          your solutions, it might function incorrectly!</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    
    
    
    <h2>Submission</h2>  
       
    <p>There is a file named <b><tt>proj3.marker</tt></b> at the top of the skeleton. 
       This file is used to locate your submission, so do not move it.</p>
       
    <p>Also notice there is a file named <b><tt>PARTNER.txt</tt></b>. Please list your 
       partner's login letters in this file, being careful not to change the formatting. 
       If you are submitting, your partner's login should be listed, and if your partner 
       is submitting, your own login should be listed. If you have no partner, you 
       should leave this file as it is.</p>
    
    <p>Only the following submitted files will be considered for grading:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><b><tt>CPU.circ</tt></b></li>
      <li><b><tt>REG.circ</tt></b></li>
      <li><b><tt>ALU.circ</tt></b></li>
      <li><b><tt>CMP.circ</tt></b></li>
      <li><b><tt>PIP.circ</tt></b></li>
      <li><b><tt>NPC.circ</tt></b></li>
      <li><b><tt>PARTNER.txt</tt></b></li>
      <li><b><tt>proj3.marker</tt></b></li> 
    </ol>
    
    <p>Again, this means that none of your circuits may use other external circuits.</p>
    
    <p>To submit this project, tag the commit you want to submit with the tag 
       <b><tt>proj3</tt></b>, and push to your git repo. For reference, the following 
       commands would submit the most recent commit in your local repository:</p>
       
    <p>
      <kbd>git status</kbd>
      <kbd>git tag proj3 -f</kbd>
      <kbd>git push --tags origin master</kbd>
    </p>
    
    <p>Don't be afraid to submit multiple times. You can move your tags around, so you 
       can choose an older commit later on if you want, or a newer commit.</p>
    
    <p>This project is due in its entirety on <em class="e">Sunday, August 10, 2014 @ 23:59:59</em>.</p>
